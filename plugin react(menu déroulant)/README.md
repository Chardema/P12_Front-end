# Dropdown

`Dropdown` is a custom React component for creating dropdown menus. It allows you to easily create and customize dropdowns in your React applications.

## Installation

To install `Dropdown`, you can use npm or yarn:

```
npm install dropdown_chardema
```

or

```
yarn add dropdown_chardema
```

## Usage

To use `Dropdown` in your React application, you'll need to import it and then use it in your JSX code. Here's an example of how to do this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Dropdown from 'dropdown_chardema';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [selectedValue, setSelectedValue] = useState(null);

  const handleChange = (value) => {
    setSelectedValue(value);
  };

  return (
    <Dropdown
      options={[
        { value: 'option1', label: 'Option 1' },
        { value: 'option2', label: 'Option 2' },
        { value: 'option3', label: 'Option 3' },
      ]}
      value={selectedValue}
      onChange={handleChange}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, we're using the `Dropdown` component to create a dropdown menu with three options. We're also keeping track of the currently selected value using the `useState` hook, and updating it when the user selects a different option from the dropdown.

## Props

`Dropdown` accepts the following props:

- `options`: An array of objects representing the options in the dropdown. Each object should have a `value` and a `label` property.
- `value`: The currently selected value in the dropdown.
- `onChange`: A callback function that is called when the user selects a different option from the dropdown. The function is passed the new selected value as its first argument.
